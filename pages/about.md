# **About Me**

Hey, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}** and I love messing around with tech 💻. I helped Epimetheus Games out with their first two games, EyeSore and Project Prometheus 🎮 (you can check 'em out on itch). I’ve been helping out with @MoeBazziGIT’s Tidy Tab Groups project 🧹 (Hey! Join the Discord HERE!!!). I live in Cape Town 🌍 and speak French 🇫🇷 and English 🇬🇧 fluently. I love photography 📸 and I take pictures with my crappy phone 📱 and post them on Insta 📷.
